## Ex1: Online vs Offline extraction. Example?
|             | Online extraction                                                                                                                                                 | Offline extraction                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Definitions | Online extraction is the process of extracting data by interacting directly with the data source (querying a database, API, etc.), in real-time or near real-time | Offline extraction entails extracting data from the source and storing it elsewhere, such as dump files, archive logs, backups, or data lakes. This is used when real-time interaction with the data source is not feasible or practical |
| Use cases   | Online extraction is used when there is a need for real-time analysis (sales, stocks, etc.) or the data tends to change quickly and dynamically                   | Offline extraction is used when there is no need for real-time analysis, such as for studies, historical trend analysis, periodical reporting, etc.                                                                                      |
| Examples    | A retail company analyzes real-time sales trends by maintaining a direct connection to continuously access the latest transaction data                            | Daily logs are extracted and stored in a data lake. These logs are later accessed for various purposes                                                                                                                                   |

## Ex2: ETL vs ELT?
|               | ETL                                                                                                                                           | ELT                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Meaning       | Extract Transform Load                                                                                                                        | Extract Load Transform                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Process       | Extract data from various sources, transformed according to business rules or requirements, and then loaded into a data warehous or data mart | Extract data, load it into a storage system (like a data lake or data warehouse) in its raw form, and transformation occurs later, often within the storage system itself or during query execution |
| Advantages    | Assure data quality, as all data are cleansed, transformed and normalized before storing in DW                                                | Preserve the entire raw data, offering flexibility for various use cases                                                                                                                            |
| Disadvantages | May result in missing some parts of the data due to pre-transformation                                                                        | Requires more storage                                                                                                                                                                               |
| When to use   | Suited for smaller datasets or when transformation requirements are well-defined and consistent                                               | Preferred for handling large volumes of data and scenarios where data structures and transformation needs may vary over time or across different analytical purposes (like large company's data)    |

|                 | Virtual Environment                                                                                                                   | Virtual Machine                                                                                                                                          | Container                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definitions     | A self-contained directory tree that contains dependency details, allowing each application install and manage their own dependencies | An emulation of a physical computer, runs their own instance of the OS Kernel and applications, mostly isolated from the host system                     | A software instance that encapsulates the application and its dependencies  |
| How they do it  | Let application install their own dependencies inside a directory separated from the global environment                               | Use hypervisor which abstracts the hardware physical resources, allow the VM use the resources without relying on host system                            | Some kernel technologies like namespaces and control groups (cgroups)       |
| What they use   | Utilizes the computer's hardware (CPU, memory, storage), OS kernel, and applications. Only separates the dependency packages          | Use the computer's hardware (CPU, memory, storage), but use its own OS kernel and applications                                                           | Use the computer's hardware (CPU, memory, storage) and OS kernel            |
| Isolation level | Isolate the dependency packages inside the environment                                                                                | Isolate the OS kernel and the applications inside it, encapsulating the whole operating system (high level of isolation).                                | Isolate at the application level, shares the OS kernel.                     |
| Portability     | Has limited portability due to differences in system architectures and dependencies                                                   | Portable across systems, as it encapsulates the entire operating system, but there might still be compatibility issues due to hypervisor incompatibility | Portable across systems, as it packages applications and their dependencies |
| Use cases       | Suitable for different projects on one machine, or when all team members have the same OS                                             | Used for projects that require a high level of isolation or OS-specific configurations                                                                   | Commonly used in software development or team projects                      |
