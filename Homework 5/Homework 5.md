## TL;DR

Creating a comparison table for different types of objects used in SQL like Common Table Expressions (CTE), Views, Temporary Tables, Table Variables, and Inline Table-Valued Functions (TVF) can help illustrate their differences:

Here's an expanded table with specific use cases to help determine when to use each option:

| Feature                 | CTE                                  | View                        | Temporary Table                          | Table Variable                         | Inline TVF                              |

| **Use Cases**           | Complex joins, recursive **queries** | Simplifying complex queries | Large temporary data manipulations       | Small temporary data manipulations     | Encapsulating and reusing complex logic |

### Detailed Use Cases:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTE)**
   - **When to Use**: When you need to simplify complex joins or recursive queries within a single statement.
   - **Example**: Generating hierarchical data or creating temporary sets for a specific query.
   - **Usage**: Simplifying readability of complex queries and performing recursive operations.

2. **View**
   - **When to Use**: When you have a query that needs to be reused across multiple queries and applications.
   - **Example**: Creating a standardized way to access specific columns from multiple tables.
   - **Usage**: Encapsulating business logic, abstracting complex queries, and simplifying maintenance.

3. **Temporary Table**
   - **When to Use**: When you need to store and manipulate large intermediate results within a session or transaction.
   - **Example**: Performing complex calculations that require multiple steps.
   - **Usage**: Handling large sets of data temporarily for batch processing or complex transactions.

4. **Table Variable**
   - **When to Use**: When you need to store and manipulate small intermediate results within a batch or function.
   - **Example**: Using a small dataset in a stored procedure or function.
   - **Usage**: Holding temporary data in a controlled scope with potentially better performance for small datasets.

5. **Inline Table-Valued Function (TVF)**
   - **When to Use**: When you need to encapsulate complex logic that returns a table and reuse it like a view.
   - **Example**: Creating a function that returns a set of rows based on input parameters.
   - **Usage**: Encapsulating and reusing complex query logic, allowing for parameterized queries.

This table and the use cases should help you decide which option is best suited for different scenarios in your SQL operations.
## CTE (Common Table Expression)
```sql
WITH cte_name AS (QUERY)
```
- A temporary result set that you can reference within a query using `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.
- Defined using `WITH` clause
- Why do we use CTEs over Subquery/Derived Table:
	- Readable and maintainable: CTEs allow you to define and name the complex part of the query first, separate them from the rest
	- Recursive CTEs
- Limitations:
	- Their scope is one *statement* (not one query, as multiple queries can use the same CTE: if nested, in other CTEs, etc.). If you want to reference a result set multiple times, you should use [temp table](#Temp%20Table) [^1]
	- Performance(?)
- Recursive CTE:
	- Structured in two parts:
		- Anchor member (Base case)
		- Recursive member (Recursive loop + Quit condition)
	- Tips for writing Recursive CTEs [^3]:
		- Start with anchor
		- Ensure the number of columns match
		- Always `UNION ALL`
		- Beware Infinite Loops (Pay attention to quit condition and anchor)
- Recursive CTE in PostgreSQL:
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE recursive_cte_name AS (
	(anchor)
	UNION ALL
	(recursive_logic WHERE exit_condition)
)
```
e.g.
1. Normal CTE
```sql
WITH class_monitor AS (
	SELECT *
	FROM students
	WHERE is_class_monitor = True
)
SELECT *
FROM class_monitor
```
2. Recursive CTE [^2]
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte (n, factorial) AS (
	VALUES (0, 1) --f0, f1
	UNION ALL
	SELECT n+1, (n+1)*factorial FROM cte WHERE n<9
)
```
Step by step execution:
![|250](Pasted%20image%2020240709161456.png)

3. Recursive CTE to get hierarchy of staff [^3]
```sql
WITH employee_manager_cte AS (
	SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 as level
	FROM employees e1
	WHERE manager_id IS NULL -- get the topmost employee i.e. the director
	UNION ALL
	SELECT
	FROM employees AS employee
	INNER JOIN employee_manager_cte manager ON employee.manager_id = manager.id
)
SELECT level, id, name, manager_id
FROM employee_manager_cte
```
The hierarchy is like this:
![|300](Pasted%20image%2020240709163334.png)
And the result

| level | id  | name        | manager_id |
| ----- | --- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1     | 91  | Sarah Smith | NULL       |
| 2     | 92  | Jane Miller | 91         |
| 3     | 93  | John Doe    | 92         |

## View
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS (QUERY);
```
- Virtual table retrieves data from tables when queried
- Does not store the data itself [^4]
- Does not take storage space but rather use memory and processing power
- How does view work? Two ways [^4] [^5]
	- Any query referring to the view is rewritten to include the query defined in the view
	- View is executed alone and the result set is stored in a [temporary table](#Temp%20Table) 
- Can you update data through a view?
	- The view must not certain SQL functions (like aggregate functions, `DISTINCT`, etc.)
	- The view must reference a single base table
	- All the columns do not allow NULLs and no default values
- Why do we use view?
	- Organising and structuring data
	- Simplifying complex queries: Encapsulate complex queries into something table-like (but not taking up storage space)
	- Security: Restrict access to specific columns or rows, exposing only the necessary data to users or applications i.e. Some users could see certain columns in a view, but does not have the access to the whole table
	- Data Abstraction: Provide an abstraction layer, allowing underlying table schema changes without affecting dependent queries
- Limitations:
	- Non-updatable views, update with a lot of restrictions
	- No indexing, making it less efficient compared to indexed base tables
	- If schema changes, the views referencing it have to be updated as well
		- Hard to manage dependencies
		- Cascading effects if views referencing views
- Materialised View:
	- Materialised views precompute and store the results of a query physically on disk
	- Used to improve performance for frequently executed queries by avoiding rerunning resource-intensive queries multiple times
	- Why not just use temporary table? (?)
## Temporary Table
```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_table_name (TABLE DEFINITION)
```
- Store results temporarily or isolating subsets of data for processing
- For local temporary table, theirs scope is one session or one transaction. Global temporary table is accessible by any session. (PostgreSQL does not support local/global. SQL Server does)
- Temporary tables are stored in a database for temporary objects
- Why do we use Temporary Table?
	- Store intermediate results
	- Break down complex queries into smaller steps
	- Isolate subsets of data for specific operations without affecting the base tables
	- Processing large datasets [^7]
	- If data needs to be shared across sessions, use global temporary tables (?) [^7]
- Limitations:
	- Consume significant memory and storage space if not managed properly
	- Temporary tables are disposed of before you can debug theirs content (?) [^7]
	- (Global temporary table) No isolation as these tables are accessible by other sessions [^7]
- When to use Temporary Table over Table Variable? [^6] [^7]
	- Indexing
	- Adding and deleting large numbers of rows
	- Large dataset (Millions of bytes)
	- Transaction
## Table Variable
```sql
DECLARE @table_variable_name TABLE (TABLE DEFINITION)
```
- A variable that holds a set of data like a table, but it's scoped to the batch, stored procedure, or function in which it's declared
- theirs scope is one routine (batch, stored procedure, function, etc.) where they are declared
- Table variables are not affected by transaction rollbacks, as they do not participate in transaction *explicitly* (?)
- Better performance for small to medium-sized dataset compared to temporary tables due to theirs reduced overhead and simpler structure
- Why do we use Table Variable?
	- Store intermediate results
	- Transaction rollback passerby: TVs are not affected by rollback operations
	- Processing small to medium-sized datasets [^7]
- Limitations:
	- Cannot alter the structure of a table variable after declaration
	- Statistics are not maintained on table variables, leading to less efficient query plans for large datasets (?)
- When to use Table Variable over Temporary Table?
	- Small, less complex datasets
	- Loose locking resources [^8]
	- Free memory early [^7]
## Inline TVFs (Inline Table-Valued Function)
```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION function_name (@param datatype)
  RETURNS TABLE
  AS RETURN (QUERY)
```
- A function that returns a table
- Returns an entire result set, which can be used in queries much like a regular table or view
- Why do we use inline TVFs?
	- Simplifying complex queries
	- Allow parameters and return table value
- Limitations:
	- Cannot contain control flow statements like `IF`, `CASE`, `WHILE`
	- Security: You have to grant `SELECT` permission to the users who need to query it
